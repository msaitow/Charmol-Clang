                          program for making high-quality pictures of molecular structures
                               using POV-Ray (Persistence of Vision Raytracer) or VRML



Charmol is a command-line based program for making high-quality pictures of molecular structures for Linux and MacOS.

Charmol works with simple ascii file input, its output can be either VRML or POV-Ray file containing the 3D scene (in case of
POV-Ray, picture rendering is automatically done from charmol by calling POV-Ray program). It is mainly oriented to small- and
medium-size molecules including orbitals, arrows etc., but it is of course also capable of doing pictures of whole proteins and
DNA using the 'all atoms' model. Very important feature of this program is the possibility to draw as many orbitals, surfaces and
vibrations as you wish during one run (without user interaction), which is not usual for graphical-interface based programs and may
be often found helpful.

Charmol is capable of doing pictures containing:

 - from small- to large-size molecules
 - more molecules together (also with different settings)
 - orbitals using molden and fchk files (GTO functions up to 'h' angular momentum supported)
 - surfaces using gaussian cube files (also color-mapped surfaces according to potential)
   (many orbitals or surfaces can be generated without user interaction)
 - schematic representation of vibrations using arrows
 - user-defined arrows representing vectorial properties
 - measuring gauges
 - combinations of some of these features (for example more orbitals together, orbitals and arrows together etc.)

Although default settings should produce very reasonable design of molecules and other objects, fine tuning of the design according
to ones needs is incorporated in the code. Users can change colors of basicaly all objects, scale radii of atoms and bonds, scale
arrows etc.

In order to produce faster code, time-consuming parts are parallelized using OpenMP. Charmol can be run either on a local machine,
or on a remote host using standard tools like queue system.

Package includes examples of input files located in the directory {your_destination_of_release}/examples.

For bug reporting and suggestions about additional functions, please contact the author:

Before reporting a bug, please first make sure that the problem is caused by charmol program and not by running povray (try to use
command-line option 'povrayverbose' when running charmol to see what povray prints during its run).

Many thanks go to Tibor Andras Rokob.


Enjoy the program!
