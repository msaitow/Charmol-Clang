# Charmol-Clang

A slightly modified version of J. Chalupsky's Charmol package. The original package is available from the follwoing link:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/charmol/

This version is compatible with clang compiler on M1 Mac devices. Moreover, surprisingly, this also compiles without any problem in a-shell environment (https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/) on iOS/iPadOS devices. The resulting VRML files for the MOs generated from molden or fchk file can be visualized with such Apps as Cortana 3D viewer. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only way to visualize the 3D data contained in MOLDEN and fchk file on such devices.
